# Block Tool
Transfers blocks between two twitter accounts.

## Usability
This tool is heavily experimental, it is not feature rich and is not suitable for production use. Only use it if you have experience using the twitter API. Check code comments.

## Future plans
Eventually I will make a node.js port/webapp to accomplish this. At that point this will lose support.
